.. admonition:: Example

    Match variations on the name "Rebecca"

    Pattern:
        :regexp:`Rebecca|Rebekah|Becky`

    Match:
        .. rst-class:: regex-matched-text-block

            Her birth certificate reads :emphasis:`Rebecca`, but
            she will sometimes spell it as :emphasis:`Rebekah`.
            However, do not refer to her
            as :emphasis:`Becky`, Bekah, or the Beckster.
