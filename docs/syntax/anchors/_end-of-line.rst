Matching the end of a line
==========================




.. admonition:: Example

    Match the character ``9`` at the *end of a line*.

    Pattern:
        :regexp:`9$`

    Match:
        .. rst-class:: regex-matched-text-block

            9 cats and 9 lives is not 9\ :emphasis:`9`
            But why 9?
            The area code for 90210 is 99\ :emphasis:`9`
