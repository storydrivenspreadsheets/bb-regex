Matching the beginning of a line
================================

.. admonition:: Example

    Match the letter ``I`` at the *beginning of a line*.

    Pattern:
        :regexp:`^I`

    Match:
        .. rst-class:: regex-matched-text-block

            :emphasis:`I` was confused. I needed help.
            So I asked the man in the yellow hat.
            :emphasis:`I` got an answer.
